@article{Eigen1988,
abstract = {The molecular quasi-species model describes the physicochemical organization of monomers into an ensemble of heteropolymers with combinatorial complexity by ongoing template polymerization. Polynucleotides belong to the simplest class of such molecules. The quasi-species itself represents the stationary distribution of macromolecular sequences maintained by chemical reactions effecting error-prone replication and by transport processes. It is obtained deterministically, by mass-action kinetics, as the dominant eigenvalue of a ualue matrix, W, which is derived directly from chemical rate coefficients, but it also exhibits stochastic features, being composed to a significant fraction of unique individual macromolecular sequences. The quasi-species model demonstrates how macromolecular information originates through specific nonequilibrium autocatalytic reactions and thus forms a bridge between reaction kinetics and molecular evolution. Selection and evolutionary optimization appear as new features in physical chemistry. Concentration bias in the production of mutants is a new concept in population genetics, relevant to frequently mutating populations, which is shown to greatly enhance the optimization properties. The present theory relates to asexually replicating ensembles, but this restriction is not essential. A sharp transition is exhibited between a drifting population of essentially random macromolecular sequences and a localized population of close relatives. This transition at a threshold error rate was found to depend on sequence lengths, distributions of selective values, and population sizes. It has been determined generically for complex landscapes and for special cases, and, it was shown to persist generically in the presence of nearly neutral mutants. Replication dynamics has much in common with the equilibrium statistics of complex spin systems: the error threshold is equivalent to a magnetic order-disorder transition. A rational function of the replication accuracy plays the role of temperature. Experimental data obtained from test-tube evolution of polynucleotides and from studies of natural virus populations support the quasi-species model. The error threshold seems to set a limit to the genome lengths of several classes of RNA viruses. In addition, the results are relevant even in eucaryotes where they contribute to the exon-intron debate},

In this paper we demonstrate that auto-correlation alone may be inadequate as a mediator of evolutionary dynamics, specifically in the presence of large scale neutrality. We introduce the NKp family of landscapes (a variant on NK landscapes) which possess the remarkable property that varying the degree of neutrality has minimal effect on the correlation structure. It is demonstrated that NKp landscapes feature neutral networks which have a ``constant innovation`` property comparable with the neutral networks observed in models of RNA secondary structure folding landscapes.

@article{Hughes2007,
abstract = {Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in evidence for positive Darwinian selection at the molecular level. This quest has been hampered by the use of statistical methods that fail adequately to rule out alternative hypotheses, particularly the relaxation of purifying selection and the effects of population bottlenecks, during which the effectiveness of purifying selection is reduced. A further problem has been the assumption that positive selection will generally involve repeated amino-acid changes to a single protein. This model was derived from the case of the vertebrate major histocompatibility complex (MHC), but the MHC proteins are unusual in being involved in protein-protein recognition and in a co-evolutionary process of pathogens. There is no reason to suppose that repeated amino-acid changes to a single protein are involved in selectively advantageous phenotypes in general. Rather adaptive phenotypes are much more likely to result from other causes, including single amino-acid changes; deletion or silencing of genes or changes in the pattern of gene expression.},

abstract = {The properties of multi-peaked “fitness landscapes” have attracted attention in a wide variety of fields, including evolutionary biology. However, relaively little attention has been paid to the properties of the landscapes themselves. Herein, we suggest a framework for the mathematical treatment of such landscapes, including an explicit mathematical model. A central role in this discussion is played by the autocorrelation of fitnesses obtained from a random walk on the landscape. Our ideas about average autocorrelations allow us to formulate a condition (satisfied by a wide class of landscapes we call AR(1) landscapes) under which the average autocorrelation approximates a decaying exponential. We then show how our mathematical model can be used to estimate both the globally optimal fitnesses of AR(1) landscapes and their local structure. We illustrate some aspects of our method with computer experiments based on a single family of landscapes (Kauffman's “N-k model”), that is shown to be a generic AR(1) landscape. We close by discussing how these ideas might be useful in the “tuning” of combinatorial optimization algorithms, and in modelling in the experimental sciences.},

Examples are the occurrence of ‘common’ structures that occupy a fraction of the genotype space which tends to unity as the length of the genotype increases, and the formation of percolating neutral networks that cover the genotype space in such a way that a member of such a network can be found within a small radius of any point in the space. We also describe a number of new phenomena that appear to be general properties of systems possessing selective neutrality. In particular, we show that the maximum fitness attained during the adaptive walk of a population evolving on such a fitness landscape increases with increasing degree of neutrality, and is directly related to the fitness of the most fit percolating network.},

abstract = {Understanding the pattern of hominin dispersal is a fundamental component of Palaeolithic archaeology and palaeoanthropology. A widely held assumption is that bifacial handaxe (i.e. Acheulean or 'Mode 2') technologies evolved in Africa and dispersed into northern and western Eurasia via subsequent hominin migrations. To date, however, few formal tests of this hypothesis have been presented. Here, we use a combination of morphometrics, cultural transmission theory, and a dispersal model drawn from population genetics in order to test this hypothesis. The iterative founder effect (repeated bottlenecking) model is assumed to be supported if a significant inverse relationship is found between geographic distance from source along an estimated dispersal route and within-assemblage variance. The results of our analyses support the hypothesis that Acheulean technologies evolved in Africa and dispersed with migrating hominin populations into northern and western Eurasia under the assumptions of this iterative founder effect model. Based on our results we suggest that the occurrence of certain Mode 1 technologies such as those east of the Movius Line, and some assemblages assigned to the Clactonian of Britain, plausibly represent instances where effective population sizes in colonising populations dropped below levels where Mode 2 technologies could be maintained. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Recent research in molecular evolution has raised awareness of the importance of selective neutrality. Several different models of neutrality have been proposed based on Kauffman's well-known NK landscape model. Two of these models, NKp and NKq, are investigated and found to display significantly different structural properties. The fitness distributions of these neutral landscapes reveal that their levels of correlation with non-neutral landscapes are significantly different, as are the distributions of neutral mutations. In this paper we describe a series of simulations of a hill climbing search algorithm on NK, NKp and NKq landscapes with varying levels of epistatic interaction. These simulations demonstrate differences in the way that epistatic interaction affects the 'searchability' of neutral landscapes. We conclude that the method used to implement neutrality has an impact on both the structure of the resulting landscapes and on the performance of evolutionary search algorithms on these landscapes. These model-dependent effects must be taken into consideration when modelling biological phenomena},

abstract = {Previous evolutionary analyses of human culture have found that a simple model of random copying, analogous to neutral genetic drift, can generate the distinct power-law frequency distribution of cultural traits that is typical of various real-world cultural datasets, such as first names, patent citations and prehistoric pottery types. Here, we use agent-based simulations to explore the effects of frequency-dependent copying (e.g., conformity and anti-conformity) on this power-law distribution. We find that when traits are actively selected on the basis of their frequency, then the power-law distribution is severely disrupted. Conformity generates a "winner-takes-all" distribution in which popular traits dominate, while anti-conformity generates a "humped" distribution in which traits of intermediate frequency are favoured. However, a more passive frequency-dependent "trimming", in which traits are selectively ignored on the basis of their frequency, generates reasonable approximations to the power-law distribution. This frequency-dependent trimming may therefore be difficult to distinguish from genuine random copying using population-level data alone. Implications for the study of both human and nonhuman culture are discussed. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Evolutionary theory predicts that a population in a new environment will accumulate adaptive substitutions, but precisely how they accumulate is poorly understood. The dynamics of adaptation depend on the underlying fitness landscape. Virtually nothing is known about fitness landscapes in nature, and few methods allow us to infer the landscape from empirical data. With a view toward this inference problem, we have developed a theory that, in the weak-mutation limit, predicts how a population's mean fitness and the number of accumulated substitutions are expected to increase over time, depending on the underlying fitness landscape. We find that fitness and substitution trajectories depend not on the full distribution of fitness effects of available mutations but rather on the expected fixation probability and the expected fitness increment of mutations. We introduce a scheme that classifies landscapes in terms of the qualitative evolutionary dynamics they produce. We show that linear substitution trajectories, long considered the hallmark of neutral evolution, can arise even when mutations are strongly selected. Our results provide a basis for understanding the dynamics of adaptation and for inferring properties of an organism's fitness landscape from temporal data. Applying these methods to data from a long-term experiment, we infer the sign and strength of epistasis among beneficial mutations in the Escherichia coli genome.},

For example, morphological evolution sometimes involves a modest number of genetic changes, with some individual changes having a large effect on the phenotype or fitness.

I also discuss the challenges that face contemporary theories of adaptation.},

abstract = {We introduce and analyze a general model of a population evolving over a network of selectively neutral genotypes. We show that the population's limit distribution on the neutral network is solely determined by the network topology and given by the principal eigenvector of the network's adjacency matrix. Moreover, the average number of neutral mutant neighbors per individual is given by the matrix spectral radius. These results quantify the extent to which populations evolve mutational robustness-the insensitivity of the phenotype to mutations-and thus reduce genetic load. Because the average neutrality is independent of evolutionary parameters-such as mutation rate, population size, and selective advantage-one can infer global statistics of neutral network topology by using simple population data available from in vitro or in vivo evolution. Populations evolving on neutral networks of RNA secondary structures show excellent agreement with our theoretical predictions.},

In this paper we propose a strategy for addressing these issues. Our strategy consists of defining a set of features of fitness landscapes that are particularly relevant to the GA, and experimentally studying how various configurations of these features affect the GA's performance along a number of dimensions. In this paper we informally describe an initial set of proposed feature classes, describe in detail one such class ("Royal Road" functions), and present some initial experimental results concerning the role of crossover and "building blocks" on landscapes constructed from features of this class. 1 Introduction Evolutionary processes are central to our understanding of natural living systems, and w...},

abstract = {We analyze the population dynamics of a broad class of fitness functions that exhibit epochal evolution---a dynamical behavior, commonly observed in both natural and artificial evolutionary processes, in which long periods of stasis in an evolving population are punctuated by sudden bursts of change. Our approach---statistical dynamics---combines methods from both statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory in a way that offers an alternative to current ``landscape'' models of evolutionary optimization. We describe the population dynamics on the macroscopic level of fitness classes or phenotype subbasins, while averaging out the genotypic variation that is consistent with a macroscopic state. Metastability in epochal evolution occurs solely at the macroscopic level of the fitness distribution. While a balance between selection and mutation maintains a quasistationary distribution of fitness, individuals diffuse randomly through selectively neutral subbasins in genotype space. Sudden innovations occur when, through this diffusion, a genotypic portal is discovered that connects to a new subbasin of higher fitness genotypes. In this way, we identify innovations with the unfolding and stabilization of a new dimension in the macroscopic state space. The architectural view of subbasins and portals in genotype space clarifies how frozen accidents and the resulting phenotypic constraints guide the evolution to higher complexity.},

@article{Gavrilets1997a,
abstract = {We study the structure and properties of adaptive landscapes arising from the assumption that genotype fitness can only be 0 (inviable genotype) or 1 (viable genotype). An appropriate image of resulting ("holey") fitness landscapes is a (multidimensional) flat surface with many holes. We have demonstrated that in the genotype space there are clusters of viable genotypes whose members can evolve from any member by single substitutions and that there are "species" defined according to the biological species concept. Assuming that the number of genes, n, is very large while the proportion of viable genotypes among all possible genotypes, p, is very small, we have deduced many qualitative and quantitative properties of holey adaptive landscapes which may be related to the patterns of speciation. Relationship between p and n determines two qualitatively different regimes: subcritical and supercritical. The subcritical regime takes place if p is extremely small. In this case, the largest clusters of viable genotypes in the genotype space have size of order n and there are many of such size; typical members of a cluster are connected by a single ("evolutionary") path; the number of different (biological) species in the cluster has order n; the expected number of different species in the cluster within k viable substitutions from any its member is of order k. The supercritical regime takes place if p is small but not extremely small. In this case, there exists a cluster of viable genotypes (a "giant" component) that has size of order 2n/n; the giant component comes "near" every point of the genotype space; typical members of the giant component are connected by many evolutionary paths; the number of different (biological) species on the "giant" component has at least order n2; the expected number of different species on the "giant" component within k viable substitution from any its member is at least of order kn. At the boundary of two regimes all properties of adaptive landscapes undergo dramatic changes, a physical analogy of which is a phase transition. We have considered the most probable (within the present framework) scenario of biological evolution on holey landscapes assuming that it starts on a genotype from the largest connected component and proceeds along it by mutation and genetic drift. In this scenario, there is no need to cross any "adaptive valleys"; reproductive isolation between populations evolves as a side effect of accumulating different mutations. The rate of divergence is very fast: a few substitutions are sufficient to result in a new biological species. We argue that macroevolution and speciation on "rugged" fitness landscapes proceed according to the properties of the corresponding holey landscapes.},

abstract = {We introduce a broadened framework to study aspects of coevolution based on the NK class of statistical models of rugged fitness landscapes. In these models the fitness contribution of each of N genes in a genotype depends epistatically on K other genes. Increasing epistatic interactions increases the rugged multipeaked character of the fitness landscape. Coevolution is thought of, at the lowest level, as a coupling of landscapes such that adaptive moves by one player deform the landscapes of its immediate partners. In these models we are able to tune the ruggedness of landscapes, how richly intercoupled any two landscapes are, and how many other players interact with each player. All these properties profoundly alter the character of the coevolutionary dynamics. In particular, these parameters govern how readily coevolving ecosystems achieve Nash equilibria, how stable to perturbations such equilibria are, and the sustained mean fitness of coevolving partners. In turn, this raises the possibility that an evolutionary metadynamics due to natural selection may sculpt landscapes and their couplings to achieve coevolutionary systems able to coadapt well. The results suggest that sustained fitness is optimized when landscape ruggedness relative to couplings between landscapes is tuned such that Nash equilibria just tenuously form across the ecosystem. In this poised state, coevolutionary avalanches appear to propagate on all length scales in a power law distribution. Such avalanches may be related to the distribution of small and large extinction events in the record.},

@article{Raman2011,
abstract = {In biological systems, individual phenotypes are typically adopted by multiple genotypes. Examples include protein structure phenotypes, where each structure can be adopted by a myriad individual amino acid sequence genotypes. These genotypes form vast connected 'neutral networks' in genotype space. The size of such neutral networks endows biological systems not only with robustness to genetic change, but also with the ability to evolve a vast number of novel phenotypes that occur near any one neutral network. Whether technological systems can be designed to have similar properties is poorly understood. Here we ask this question for a class of programmable electronic circuits that compute digital logic functions. The functional flexibility of such circuits is important in many applications, including applications of evolutionary principles to circuit design. The functions they compute are at the heart of all digital computation. We explore a vast space of 10(45) logic circuits ('genotypes') and 10(19) logic functions ('phenotypes'). We demonstrate that circuits that compute the same logic function are connected in large neutral networks that span circuit space. Their robustness or fault-tolerance varies very widely. The vicinity of each neutral network contains circuits with a broad range of novel functions. Two circuits computing different functions can usually be converted into one another via few changes in their architecture. These observations show that properties important for the evolvability of biological systems exist in a commercially important class of electronic circuitry. They also point to generic ways to generate fault-tolerant, adaptable and evolvable electronic circuitry.},

    abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the important insights of quasi-species theory is an error-threshold. The error-threshold is the error rate of replication above which the sudden onset of the population delocalization from the fittest genotype occurs despite Darwinian selection; i.e., the break down of evolutionary optimization. However, a recent article by Wilke in this journal, after reviewing the previous studies on the error-threshold, concluded that the error-threshold does not exist if lethal mutants are taken into account in a fitness landscape. Since lethal mutants obviously exist in reality, this has a significant implication about biological evolution. However, the study of Wagner and Krall on which Wilke's conclusion was based considered mutation-selection dynamics in one-dimensional genotype space with the assumption that a genotype can mutate only to an adjoining genotype in the genotype space. In this article, we study whether the above conclusion holds in high-dimensional genotype space without the assumption of the adjacency of mutations, where the consequences of mutation-selection dynamics can be qualitatively different. RESULTS: To examine the effect of mutant lethality on the existence of the error-threshold, we extend the quasi-species equation by taking the lethality of mutants into account, assuming that lethal genotypes are uniformly distributed in the genotype space. First, with the simplification of neglecting back mutations, we calculate the error-threshold as the maximum allowable mutation rate for which the fittest genotype can survive. Second, with the full consideration of back mutations, we study the equilibrium population distribution and the ancestor distribution in the genotype space as a function of error rate with and without lethality in a multiplicative fitness landscape. The results show that a high lethality of mutants actually introduces an error-threshold in a multiplicative fitness landscape in sharp contrast to the conclusion of Wilke. Furthermore, irrespective of the lethality of mutants, the delocalization of the population from the fittest genotype occurs for an error rate much smaller than random replication. Finally, the results are shown to extend to a system of finite populations. CONCLUSION: High lethality of mutants introduces an error-threshold in a multiplicative fitness landscape. Furthermore, irrespective of the lethality of mutants, the break down of evolutionary optimization happens for an error rate much smaller than random replication.},
