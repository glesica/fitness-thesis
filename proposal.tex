\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{}
The theory of neutral evolution was first proposed by Kimura~\cite{Kimura1984}
to explain observed differences between evolution in populations of larger
organisms and evolution at the molecular level. A population undergoing
neutral evolution is able to ``explore'' genotype space through neutral
mutations. Neutral mutation refers to mutations that have little or no affect
on the fitness of an organism. In biology, this is the result of a many-to-one
relationship between genotypes and phenotypes~\cite{Newman1998}.

\paragraph{}
A population undergoing neutral evolution is likely to exhibit high genotypic
diversity. This presents opportunities for the population. Its members are able
to drift through genotypic space since selective pressure does not operate in
the context of neutral mutations. As a result, there is a greater likelihood
that some population member will ``discover'' a genotype that can easily mutate
into a genotype that maps to a higher-fitness phenotype, elevating the entire
population assuming the mutation fixes.

\paragraph{}
In computational modeling we can think of two genotypes that produce the same
phenotype (or which have equal fitness), each of which may be produced by
mutating the other in some small way, as two nodes in a neutral network. Many
such networks may exist for a particular genome, each corresponding to a
particular phenotype or fitness level. In some cases, each of these networks
will be small. In other cases, such networks may be expansive and may permeate
the genotype space. In the case where the neutral network for a given phenotype
(or fitness value) forms a single giant component (or comes close) it is said
to be a percolating neutral network.

\paragraph{}
A set of genotypes and their corresponding phenotypes or fitness levels make up
a fitness landscape, which is simply a visual metaphor. The intuition is that
higher ground within the landscape corresponds to higher fitness. Fitness
landscapes can be smooth or rugged. Smooth landscapes have lower peaks, in
other words there is less difference between fit and unfit genotypes. Fitness
landscapes can also be correlated or uncorrelated. A correlated landscape
exhibits auto-correlation. This is most naturally understood as the expected
correlation between successive fitness values during a random walk across the
landscape. Visually, a correlated landscape might look similar to rolling
hills, whereas an uncorrelated landscape would appear jagged.

\paragraph{}
We can think of exploring a fitness landscape by following neutral pathways
that may or may not form a percolating (or nearly so) network. Random mutation
drives this process.  Eventually, some individual will mutate off of the
neutral network and onto a neutral network with higher fitness, and this
mutation will fix within the population with some probability.

\paragraph{}
Fitness landscapes have traditionally been seen as rugged, with many, more or
less independent, peaks and valleys pervading the space. Under these
conditions, it is possible, even likely, that a population undergoing an
adaptive walk will become ``trapped'' at a local optimum.

\paragraph{}
Neutral landscapes, on the other hand, can be more accurately conceived as
mountain ranges, with ridges running along slopes joining together peaks, and
saddles between the peaks themselves. Adaptive walks on such landscapes are
likely to result in higher fitness or, put another way, populations are less
likely to become stuck at local optima~\cite{Newman1998}.

\section{Hypotheses}

\subsection{Mutation-Selection Balance}

\paragraph{}
Gavrilets demonstrated~\cite{Gavrilets1997} that, on an uncorrelated landscape,
the percolation threshold for a fitness landscape is inversely correlated with
the number of dimensions under consideration. We hypothesize that this is true
for correlated landscapes as well, given an appropriate balance between
selection and mutation pressures.

\section{Methods}

\paragraph{}
To facilitate testing our hypotheses, we intend to create two pieces of
reusable software, both of which will be released as open source software.

\subsection{NK.jl Library}

\paragraph{}
We have opted to generalize our NK landscape
implementation\footnote{\url{https://github.com/glesica/NK.jl}} so that it may
be used by others in the future. We will provide it as a separate package under
a permissive license that will hopefully allow future work and improvement.  We
will use this library for our own experiments in addition to contributing it to
the community as open source software.

\paragraph{}
We intend to implement several NK variants including NKq and NKp neutral
landscapes. We will also provide implementations of several common techniques
such as adaptive walks and proportional selection from a population.

\subsection{CGP.jl Library}

\paragraph{}
Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) eschews the tree structures more commonly
associated with genetic programming in favor of a grid (hence ``Cartesian'') of
functions that can take as their inputs the outputs from any preceding
functions. Our CGP library\footnote{\url{https://github.com/glesica/CGP.jl}}
attempts to combine computation performance with ease-of-use.

\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Shifting Balance Experiment}

\paragraph{}
The first project will test the shifting balance theory proposed by
Wright~\cite{Wright1982}\cite{Wright1931}. We will enumerate the possible
genotypes for small NK and NKp landscapes, then compute the
prominence\footnote{Prominence is a concept from topography. The prominence of
a peak is defined to be the vertical distance between the peak and the
lowest contour line encircling it that has no higher summit.} and identify the
key col\footnote{The key col, also called the saddle point, of a peak is the
lowest point on the highest ridge between a peak and a higher peak that
defines its prominence.} for each fitness peak.

\paragraph{}
Ordinarily, a large population would be unlikely to move between fitness peaks,
even on a neutral landscape. Wright's theory attempted to resolve the apparent
conflict between theory and observation by suggesting that a subpopulation may
be able to sustain temporarily reduced fitness given a sufficiently high rate
of mutation and a sufficiently low rate of gene flow. Wright suggested that a
subpopulations might ``jump'' to a neighboring domain of attraction and climb
the corresponding peak. The beneficial mutation might then fix in the larger
population. We propose that this process is simpler and more likely to occur if
there exist neutral or nearly-neutral ridges between peaks.
