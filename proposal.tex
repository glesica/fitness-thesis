\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{}
The theory of neutral evolution was first proposed by Kimura~\cite{Kimura1984}
to explain observed differences between evolution in populations of larger
organisms and evolution at the molecular level. A population undergoing
neutral evolution is able to ``explore'' genotype space through neutral
mutations. Neutral mutation refers to mutations that have little or no affect
on the fitness of an organism. In biology, this is the result of a many-to-one
relationship between genotypes and phenotypes~\cite{Newman1998}.

\paragraph{}
A population undergoing neutral evolution is likely to exhibit high genotypic
diversity. This presents opportunities for the population. Its members are able
to drift through genotypic space since selective pressure does not operate in
the context of neutral mutations. As a result, there is a greater likelihood
that some population member will ``discover'' a genotype that can easily mutate
into a genotype that maps to a higher-fitness phenotype, elevating the entire
population assuming the mutation fixes.

\paragraph{}
In computational modeling we can think of two genotypes that produce the same
phenotype (or which have equal fitness), each of which may be produced by
mutating the other in some small way, as two nodes in a neutral network. Such
networks may be extensive, permeating genotype space. In the case in which the
neutral network for a given phenotype (or fitness value) forms a single giant
component (or comes close) it is said to be a percolating neutral network.

\paragraph{}
We can think of exploring a fitness landscape by following neutral pathways
that may or may not form a percolating (or nearly so) network. Random mutation
drives this process.  Eventually, some individual will mutate off of the
neutral network and onto a neutral network with higher fitness, and this
mutation will fix within the population with some probability.

\paragraph{}
Fitness landscapes have traditionally been seen as rugged, with many, more or
less independent, peaks and valleys pervading the space. Under these
conditions, it is possible, even likely, that a population undergoing an
adaptive walk will become ``trapped'' at a local optimum.

\paragraph{}
Neutral landscapes, on the other hand, can be more accurately conceived as
mountain ranges, with ridges running along slopes joining together peaks, and
saddles between the peaks themselves. Adaptive walks on such landscapes are
likely to result in higher fitness or, put another way, populations are less
likely to become stuck at local optima~\cite{Newman1998}.

\section{Goals}

\paragraph{}
We intend to create two pieces of reusable software. We have chosen to
implement both using the Julia\footnote{\url{http://julialang.org/}}
programming language. The first is a library to facilitate experiments using
the NK family of fitness landscapes. We will use this library for our own
experiments in addition to contributing it to the community as open source
software. Additional details are provided below. The second is a library for
performing Cartesian Genetic
Programming\footnote{\url{http://www.cartesiangp.co.uk/}} in Julia. We plan to
use this library to test hypotheses and in future projects.

\paragraph{}
We also intend to use the aforementioned software to test several hypotheses
related to neutral landscapes and evolutionary computation. We hope to produce
results that are relevant to biological evolution as well.

\section{Projects}

\subsection{NK.jl Library}

\paragraph{}
We have opted to generalize our NK landscape
implementation\footnote{\url{https://github.com/glesica/NK.jl}} so that it may
be used by others in the future. We will provide it as a separate package under
a permissive license that will hopefully allow future work and improvement.

\paragraph{}
We intend to implement several NK variants including NKq and NKp neutral
landscapes. We will also provide implementations of several common techniques
such as adaptive walks and proportional selection from a population.

\subsection{CGP.jl Library}

\paragraph{}
Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) eschews the tree structures more commonly
associated with genetic programming in favor of a grid (hence ``cartesian'') of
functions that can take as their inputs the outputs from any preceeding
functions.

\section{Experiments}

\subsection{Shifting Balance Experiment}

\paragraph{}
The first project will test the shifting balance theory proposed by
Wright~\cite{Wright1982}\cite{Wright1931}. We will enumerate the possible
genotypes for small NK and NKp landscapes, then compute the
prominence\footnote{Prominence is a concept from topography. The prominence of
a peak is defined to be the vertical distance between the peak and the
lowest countour line encircling it that has no higher summit.} and identify the
key col\footnote{The key col, also called the saddle point, of a peak is the
lowest point on the highest ridge between a peak and a higher peak that
defines its prominence.} for each fitness peak.

\paragraph{}
Ordinarily, a large population would be unlikely to move between fitness peaks,
even on a neutral landscape. Wright's theory attempted to resolve the apparent
conflict between theory and observation by suggesting that a subpopulation may
be able to sustain temporarily reduced fitness given a sufficiently high rate
of mutation and a sufficiently low rate of gene flow. Wright suggested that a
subpopulations might ``jump'' to a neighboring domain of attraction and climb
the corresponding peak. The beneficial mutation might then fix in the larger
population. We propose that this process is simpler and more likely to occur if
there exist neutral or nearly-neutral ridges between peaks.
