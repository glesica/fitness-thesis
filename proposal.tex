\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{}
The theory of neutral evolution was first proposed by Kimura~\cite{Kimura1984}
to explain observed differences between evolution in populations of larger
organisms and evolution at the molecular level. In neutral evolution a
population diffuses through genotype space along neutral pathways that form a
percolating network. That is, it is possible to ``move'' from one genotype to
the next without a difference in fitness. Random mutation drives this process.
Eventually, some individual will mutate off of the neutral network and onto a
neutral network with higher fitness, and this mutation will fix within the
population with some probability.

\paragraph{}
Neutrality may be of interest to a variety of fields outside the biological
sciences, including practioners of evolutionary computation.
