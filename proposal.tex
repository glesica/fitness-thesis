\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{}
The theory of neutral evolution was first proposed by Kimura~\cite{Kimura1984}
to explain observed differences between evolution in populations of larger
organisms and evolution at the molecular level. In neutral evolution a
population diffuses through genotype space along neutral pathways that form a
percolating network. That is, it is possible to ``move'' from one genotype to
the next without a difference in fitness. Random mutation drives this process.
Eventually, some individual will mutate off of the neutral network and onto a
neutral network with higher fitness, and this mutation will fix within the
population with some probability.

\paragraph{}
Neutrality may be of interest to a variety of fields outside the biological
sciences, including evolutionary computation. Fitness landscapes have
traditionally been seen as rugged, with many, more or less independent, peaks
and valleys pervading the space. Under these conditions, it is possible, even
likely, that a population undergoing an adaptive walk on such a landscape will
become ``trapped'' at a local optimum.

\paragraph{}
Neutral landscapes, on the other hand, can be seen more as mountain ranges,
with ridges running along slopes joining together peaks, and saddles between
the peaks themselves. Adaptive walks on such landscapes are likely to result in
higher fitness or, put another way, populations are less likely to become stuck
at local optima~\cite{Newman1998}.

\section{Goals}

\paragraph{}
We intend to create two pieces of reusable software. We have chosen to
implement both using the Julia\footnote{\url{http://julialang.org/}}
programming language. The first is a library to facilitate experiments using
the NK family of fitness landscapes. We will use this library for our own
experiments in addition to contributing it to the community as open source
software. Additional details are provided below.

\section{Projects}

\subsection{NK.jl Library}

\paragraph{}
We have opted to generalize our NK landscape
implementation\footnote{\url{https://github.com/glesica/NK.jl}} so that it may
be used by others in the future. We will provide it as a separate package under
a permissive license that will hopefully allow future work and improvement.

\paragraph{}
We intend to implement several NK variants including NKp neutral landscapes. We
will also provide implementations of several common techniques such as adaptive
walks and proportional selection from a population.

\subsection{Shifting Balance Experiment}

\paragraph{}
The first project will test the shifting balance theory proposed by
Wright~\cite{Wright1982}\cite{Wright1931}. We will enumerate the possible
genotypes for small NK and NKp landscapes, then compute the
prominence\footnote{Prominence is a concept from topography. The prominence of
a peak is defined to be the vertical distance between the peak and the
lowest countour line encircling it that has no higher summit.} and identify the
key col\footnote{The key col, also called the saddle point, of a peak is the
lowest point on the highest ridge between a peak and a higher peak that
defines its prominence.} for each fitness peak.

\paragraph{}
Ordinarily, a large population would be unlikely to move between fitness peaks,
even on a neutral landscape. Wright's theory attempted to resolve the apparent
conflict between theory and observation by suggesting that a subpopulation may
be able to sustain temporarily reduced fitness given a sufficiently high rate
of mutation and a sufficiently low rate of gene flow. Wright suggested that a
subpopulations might ``jump'' to a neighboring domain of attraction and climb
the corresponding peak. The beneficial mutation might then fix in the larger
population. We propose that this process is simpler and more likely to occur if
there exist neutral or nearly-neutral ridges between peaks.
